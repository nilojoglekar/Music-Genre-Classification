# Music-Genre-Classification
The objective of this project is to do a comparative study to detect and classify music files automatically
based on its genre by using various classification algorithms. Music genre classification is a popular
problem in the domain of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) used in many music streaming platforms
such as Pandora which is an automated music recommendation service based on the Music Genome
Project, that suggests songs to users based on similarity of songs that the user is interested in. In this
project we have done a comparative study using various machine learning classification algorithms to
classify music files based on its genre.
